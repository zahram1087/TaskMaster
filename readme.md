* Both Tasks and Projects should be saved locally to a database.
* A user should be able to “Assign” themselves a task, “Accept” that task, and later “Complete” that task.

### Available - the task has been created, and is publicly available, but no other user has claimed it yet

* Accepted - the assignee has accepted that task
* Finished - the task is totally complete Write tests making sure a task progresses through it’s states properly

* Users should be able to view all of the tasks assigned to them on a screen.
* Users should be able to sort the tasks assigned to them based on the title of the task, the state the task is in, or the person who assigned the task to them
* This sorting should be done in the cloud, to avoid using too many resources on the user’s phone.

# Feature Tasks: LAB 43
